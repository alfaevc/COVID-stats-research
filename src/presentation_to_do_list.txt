Order Comparison Visualization Modification:
	- use new data for all visualizations
	- dots representing orders same color as state
	- increase shape size
	- use Black X on Sept.7th as mark of school opening
	- fix code so that if there is no mask order, skip the state
	- solid black line at x=0
	- turn 1L,2E... into words

Time Series Plots can include: Washington, Kansas

Presentation:
	- Overview/goal
	- what's the data. How was the data collected 
	- graphs: time series (eg.tx,fl,la,pa,az) (states and IOWA counties-henry,winniston?)
		-> comparing orders across states. good example 4E wisconsin 
			take more than 30 days to see the affect
		-> lag graphs
		-> take home messages: take a while up till a month 
	- spline models
	- future work (towards ARMA) and working towards multi variable model
